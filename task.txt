*Task 2: Download data or Scrape
Delaware COVID-19 Dashboard
1. See state dashboard: https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/
2. See more data:
https://myhealthycommunity.dhss.delaware.gov/locations/state
3. Get Zipcode specific data:Example
https://myhealthycommunity.dhss.delaware.gov/locations/zip-code-19734
Deliverable:
1) Write a python script to download all zipcode data in DE.
2) Write another python script to validate that all zipcode data is downloaded
3) Provide a structured zipped directory of as much data as possible (preferably
programmatically generated)

The first step is to inventory the Delaware covid dashboard 
for what data can be downloaded into a csv. 
The second step may be to write a script to download the csv files.
